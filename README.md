# .dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles that I use for linux

This project uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage dotfiles

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ricky12Awesome/.dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
```

You must install these yourself, not a complete list, 
since I don't know what is exactly required for each package, 
but will update it when needed
